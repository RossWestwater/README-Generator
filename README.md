# README-Generator ![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)

## Description 

This app generates a professional README.md file by following the prompts through Node.js. Instead of having to referring to templates for editing, this application can generate all the crucial sections that are needed for a readme in a given project. I gained a better understanding of function parameter and argument usage and playing with arrow functions was fun, too. I aim to continue trying to understand when and why to use promises and the syntax required to master modularizing datasheets and further clean my code. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Tests

To challenge myself, I added a section to add screen shots to the document. A person type the alt text and relative path of the file (which must also still be in the project's repo). I enjoyed trying to puzzle the functionality out.
